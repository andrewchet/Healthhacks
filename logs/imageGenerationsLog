The goal is to empower users to take control of their physical health, especially those dealing with recurring or activity-related pain.  ⸻  🔑 Core Features:  1. 🧍‍♂️ Interactive Body Model 	•	Users can tap a 3D or flat model of the human body to indicate where they’re experiencing pain. 	•	The model can expand for more detailed selection (e.g., elbow vs. forearm). 	•	Once tapped, the app prompts for: 	•	Type of pain (sharp, dull, sore, etc.) 	•	Cause (injury, overuse, unknown, etc.) 	•	Activity at the time (e.g., lifting weights, woke up with it) 	•	Optional: Add photo of the area  ⸻  2. 📝 Smart Daily Logging 	•	Clean UI to log pain entries: date, time, severity, location, and relief methods. 	•	App asks helpful, cautious questions (e.g., “What were you doing before the pain started?”). 	•	Users can track trends over time.  ⸻  3. 💬 Chat with AI (GPT-4) 	•	In-app chatbot where users can ask: 	•	“Why does my shoulder hurt after incline bench?” 	•	“Is this pain normal or serious?” 	•	GPT provides: 	•	Informative yet cautious answers 	•	Possible causes and common injuries 	•	Recommends stretches or rest (with sources) 	•	Flags serious symptoms and recommends seeing a doctor when needed  ⸻  4. 🚨 Safety & Referrals 	•	If a user logs a high-risk symptom (e.g., chest pain, numbness), the app responds with: 	•	“This may require medical attention. Would you like help finding a provider near you?” 	•	Links to: 	•	Doctor finder tools 	•	Urgent care maps 	•	Online telehealth platforms 	•	Cautious language to avoid fear-mongering but support safety  ⸻  5. 📊 History + Graphs 	•	Log archive with filters (by date, joint, severity) 	•	Graphs showing: 	•	Pain frequency 	•	Intensity over time 	•	Triggers vs. recovery windows 	•	Clean, swipeable UI with stats  ⸻  6. ⚙️ Settings & Preferences 	•	Toggle light/dark mode 	•	Set reminders to log pain daily 	•	Choose units (e.g., time in 12h/24h) 	•	Customize joint model (e.g., only show lower body)  ⸻  7. 🖼️ Design Language 	•	Minimal, Apple-native feel 	•	Font: Charter Bold BT (lowercase for headings) 	•	Background: clean white or soft cream 	•	Bubbles UI for active pain logs (shrink as more are added) 	•	Smooth swipe navigation between pages  ⸻  🛠️ Stack Plan: 	•	Frontend: SwiftUI (iOS native app) 	•	Alternative: React Native + Expo (if you want cross-platform in future) 	•	Backend (Optional): Firebase – user auth, log storage 	•	AI Integration: GPT-4 (via OpenAI API) 	•	Charts: Swift Charts or React Native Chart Kit (if cross-platform)  ⸻  🧪 Status: 	•	You’re building and testing in Xcode on your iPhone via Mac 	•	Interface has been prototyped with: 	•	Welcome/login screen 	•	Model + logging interface 	•	Chat screen with GPT integration 	•	History and stats screen 	•	Some images/exports may have had formatting issues, but final build is being prepared for TestFlight submission and/or possible conversion to React Native if you go web-based later  ⸻  🌍 Future Ideas: 	•	Telehealth API integration 	•	Sync with Apple Health for sleep, movement 	•	Auto-trigger alerts if pain logs hit a dangerous trend "\nImage URI: https://images.composerapi.com/A8435A7E-594F-4707-8E92-5A8B60960B08.jpg\n\n[2025-07-07T20:12:57.057Z] System note: Image provided by user\nPrompt: "It’s two condensed here can you make it easy to go through"\nImage URI: https://images.composerapi.com/E41BC39B-B88F-4BD1-87A7-24F001634512.jpg\n\n[2025-07-07T20:31:34.829Z] System note: Image provided by user\nPrompt: "I don’t see anything you’ve added in the provider dashboard "\nImage URI: https://images.composerapi.com/F3E42EAB-F9D6-4617-BFF6-9FEB7B9CE23F.jpg\n\n[2025-07-07T21:11:05.123Z] System note: Image provided by user\nPrompt: "I just don’t see it in the provider dash board "\nImage URI: https://images.composerapi.com/BD7522A9-34F1-4066-9E48-7AD548AE129D.jpg\n\n[2025-07-08T03:47:55.967Z] System note: Image provided by user\nPrompt: "Can you make it so I just see the paragraph and also make it so I see everything and take out the wierd jumbo at the start of the paragraph please the json natural summary part "\nImage URI: https://images.composerapi.com/FFDD4252-4F9B-4E39-A02C-65521F9C4C5F.jpg\n\n
